Dear visitor,

Welcome!

I work as a Research Scientist at SnT — the Interdisciplinary Research Centre on Security, Reliability and Trust (SnT) of the University of Luxembourg. My research activities focuses mainly on software engineering, with a focus on software verification and testing, decision-making software, and data-intensive/machine-learning systems. I am one of the three permanent scientists of the SnT centre’s SeRVal group (SEcurity, Reasoning and VALidation), headed by Prof. Yves Le Traon and composed of 30+ researchers. 

The key vision that drives my research is to empower Industry and Society with the capability to develop and deploy complex software solution effectively and reliably. To achieve this, I develop and evaluate theories, methods and tools across multiple application domains and technology readiness levels. In particular, my research interests include: 

* verification techniques for complex systems (e.g. cyber-physical systems, variability-intensive systems)

* quality assurance and security for machine learning 

* design and development of industrial AI-based systems 

My research is inspired from and applies to several industry partners in various domains such as finance, energy and automotive. I am deeply engaged in technology transfer and collaborative research with the industry, e.g. through the creation of spin-off companies and the leadership of private-public partnership projects at SnT.

My work has been advertised in public media, including [RTL](https://www.rtl.lu/mobiliteit/news/a/2085089.html), Paperjam ([AI security](), AI space applications [1](https://paperjam.lu/article/developing-space-weather-forec), [2](https://paperjam.lu/article/developing-space-weather-forec-2)) and [Research Luxembourg](https://www.researchluxembourg.org/en/in-conversation-with-our-young-researchers-maxime-cordy/).
